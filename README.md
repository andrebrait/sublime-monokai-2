# Sublime Text 2 Monokai Theme for Jetbrains IDEs
A color scheme for JetBrains IDEs inpired by Sublime Text 2's Monokai.

This color theme primarily targets Java and Python and I've used it on IntelliJ IDEA and PyCharm.

I found this theme many years ago for Eclipse and I never found anything that was as good as this, so I ported it over to IntelliJ and fixed a bunch of issues.

It's my main theme, so I'll always be fixing stuff in case IDEA breaks it.

It has some unique features I don't often find in other themes, so give it a try. The one that stands out the most is method calls having different colors depending on whether or not the calling type has an implementation of it or not. It promptly tells you what the nature of the call is and if you're expecing the implementation to be only in the subclasses.
